#Neos are coming#

Did you know that NASA keeps an eye on asteroids hurtling their way toward our planet?

Some of them are tiny, but some of them are huge!

Some of them will miss the Earth by a wide margin, but some get very close!

**The project**

Build a website that provides information on the asteroids coming in the next 7 days.
In other words, your site should retrieve 7 days' worth of data from NASA every time the page is
refreshed.
